File g293vesicle.mat:
	- "amplitudes" is a list of bin centers
	- "frequencies" gives the corresponding number of times at which amplitudes
	  falling in each bin were observed.

The first bin contains the trials in which a stimulus evoked no response
(failures).

Files g293vesicle.xlsx, g293vesicle.csv, and g293vesicle.npy:
	- The first column contains amplitudes.
	- The second column contains frequencies.

To show more clearly the discreteness of the response, the mean number of neurotransmitter vesicles released in response to an action potential was reduced relative to normal by raising the concentration of magnesium in the solution surrounding the cells. The muscle cell was itself prevented from firing any action potential; thus, its electrical response was a proxy for the amount of neurotransmitter actually released.
