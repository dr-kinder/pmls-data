Second column is observed frequency [Fig 2A2 of Laxminarayan, R., et al. (2020). Epidemiology and transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian states. Science (New York, N.Y.), 370(6517), 691â€“697. doi.org/10.1126/science.abd7672].
Laxminarayan.npz : Same data in variables named ell and frequency.

Authors' description:
"Individual-level epidemiological data on cases and contacts, as well as laboratory test results, were available from 575,071 tested contacts of 84,965 confirmed cases. 

No positive contacts were identified for 70.7% of index cases for whom reliable contact-tracing data, including test results, were available (Fig. 2A). The distribution of the number of positive contacts linked to each index case was heavily right-skewed, and we estimated a negative binomial dispersion parameter for the distribution of the number of infected contacts traced to each index case of 0.51.

Although our analysis is limited in that it does not necessarily capture all secondary infections (e.g., among contacts who were not reported), these observations are consistent with the presence of superspreading related to differences in individual contact patterns."
