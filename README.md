This folder contains all of the data sets described in the second edition of
_Physical Models of Living Systems_ by Philip Nelson.

For the first edition, see the "first-edition" branch of this repository.

Several of these data sets are also used in _A Student's Guide to Python for
Physical Modeling_ by Jesse M. Kinder and Philip Nelson.

Use of these data sets is subject to the terms of LICENSE.txt.

Most data sets are available in .csv, .npy, and .mat formats.  

The following data sets are included.

* `01-HIVseries` --- Time series data for HIV infection
* `02-Population` --- World population data, by year
* `03-ShotNoise` --- Arrival times of photons in an avalanche photodiode
* `04-Brownian` --- Jean Perrin's data on Brownian motion
* `05-Clusters` --- Geographic coordinates of bombings in WWII London
* `06-LDexpt` --- Luria and Delbruck's data on bacterial mutation
* `07-Stocks` --- Weekly closing price of the Dow Jones
* `08-FlowCytometry` --- Fluorescence values for immune-system cells
* `09-COVID` --- COVID infection time series data
* `10-BrownianTrap` --- Time series data for a particle in an optical trap
* `11-CryoEM` --- Cryo electron microscopy data
* `12-Photodiodeblips` --- Photodector trace data
* `13-Vesicle` --- Electric potential in muscle tissue
* `14-MyosinV` --- Time series data for stepping of the molecular motor myosin
* `15-LinearFitPoisson` --- Radioactive decay data
* `16-Bursting` --- mRNA count time series
* `17-Colquhoun` --- Single ion channel recording
* `18-Kinesin` --- Kinesin velocity data
* `19-HbMb` --- Oxygen binding data for hemoglobin and myglobin
* `20-Autoregulation` --- Effect of gene regulation on protein expression
* `21-Epidemic` --- Measles outbreak data
* `22-Novick` --- Induced beta-galactosidase activity in bacteria
* `23-Superspreaders` --- Cov-2 infections attributed to individuals

The following folders are not part of the Second Edition of _PMLS_, but they are
referenced in _A Student's Guide to Python_.

* `01HIVseries` --- Time series data for HIV infection
* `16catphoto` --- Black and white picture of a cat, and image filters
* `15novick` --- Induced beta-galactosidase activity in bacteria
* `17stressFibers` --- Images of fibers in stem cells under stress
