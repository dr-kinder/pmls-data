Electric potential in muscles.

File g293vesicle.mat:
	- "amplitudes" is a list of bin centers
	- "frequencies" gives the corresponding number of times at which amplitudes
	  falling in each bin were observed.

The first bin contains the trials in which a stimulus evoked no response
(failures).

Files g293vesicle.xlsx, g293vesicle.csv, and g293vesicle.npy:
	- The first column contains amplitudes.
	- The second column contains frequencies.

Data from Boyd and Martin. The end-plate potential in mammalian muscle.
