Data from Golding et al 2005

GoldingData.mat:
	- panelA1,2,3:	data from three different trials.
		Column 1:	time after induction, minutes
		Column 2:	sample mean of the number of mRNA molecules per bacterium

	- panelC: 
		Column 1: 	log_10 of the sample mean of mRNA count in steady state,
					for various degrees of induction.
		Column 2:	log_10 of the corresponding sample variances of mRNA count

	- panelD1,2,3:	data from three different trials.
		Column 1:	time after induction, minutes
		Column 2:	natural log of fraction of cells with zero copies of mRNA

panelA1.txt etc, panelC.txt, panelD1.txt, panelA1.npy etc, panelC.npy, panelD1.npy etc. and GoldingData.npz:
	Same data in other formats.
