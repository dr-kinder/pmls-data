Influence of synthetic governor on cell protein count. 

rosenfeld.mat: 
	- regulatedX:	experimental data for regulated gene in each of 3 trials
		Column 1:	time in units of cell cycles
		Column 2:	protein per cell normalized to its final value
	- unregulated:	data for the unregulated system.
		Column 1:	time in units of cell cycles
		Column 2:	protein per cell normalized to its final value

In each variable, column 1 is time in units of cell cycles;
column 2 is protein per cell normalized to its final value. 

rosenfeld.csv and rosenfeld.xlsx:
	Same data in spreadsheet form.
