File rosenfeld.mat: Synthetic governor. 
	- regulatedX:	experimental data for regulated gene in each of 3 trials
		Column 1:	time in units of cell cycles
		Column 2:	protein per cell normalized to its final value
	- unregulated:	data for the unregulated system.
		Column 1:	time in units of cell cycles
		Column 2:	protein per cell normalized to its final value

In each variable, column 1 is time in units of cell cycles;
column 2 is protein per cell normalized to its final value. 

rosenfeld.csv and rosenfeld.xlsx: Same data in spreadsheet form.

rosenfield.npz: Same data as in .npz format

Individual data sets are available in the following:
	regulatedCyan.csv, regulatedPurple.csv, regulatedRed.csv, unregulated.csv
	regulatedCyan.npy, regulatedPurple.npy, regulatedRed.npy, unregulated.npy
