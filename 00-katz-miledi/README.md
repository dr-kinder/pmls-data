Intracellular recording from an end-plate in frog sartorius at 21°C.
Data extracted from Figure 1 of Katz and Miledi (1972).

Katz, Bernard, and Ricardo Miledi.
"The statistical nature of the acetylcholine potential and its molecular components."
The Journal of physiology 224, no. 3 (1972): 665.

`resting-cell.csv` is the trace for the cell in its resting state.
`exposed-cell.csv` is the trace for the cell after exposure to acetylcholine.

Katz and Miledi report, "During ACh action, an average depolarization
of 8.5 mV (from 93 to 84.5 mV) was registered." The oscilloscope traces in the
figure do not give the absolute voltage, so the voltage data have been centered
on these values.

Time values for the samples were inferred from the 50 ms scale bar in Figure 1.
